## The Address

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Seed String** | `KEETA_BURN_FUCKING_ADDRESS` |
| **Curve Point (RFC 9380)** | `87cd3326f756e268fa58490de86eb87ecbfdebd77c7708bb9f0a480bb6203f6a` |
| **Keeta Address** | `keeta_agd42mzg65loe2h2lbeq32doxb7mx7pl256hocf3t4feqc5wea7wv7xtd2gue` |

## Derivation Method

We use the **IETF-standardized** [RFC 9380 Hash-to-Curve](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9380/) algorithm (Elligator2) to generate a valid Ed25519 curve point from a public seed string.

```
Seed String → RFC 9380 Hash-to-Curve → Valid Ed25519 Curve Point → Keeta Address
```

This **guarantees** the output is a valid curve point—eliminating all ambiguity about whether a private key could exist.

## Verification

### Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repo and run:
bun run scripts/verify.ts
```

### Browser Console
Visit [justfuckinguseburnaddress.com](https://justfuckinguseburnaddress.com/) and paste the verification script from the "How to Verify" section into your browser's Developer Console (F12).

## Security

- **RFC 9380 Guarantee**: The Elligator2 algorithm guarantees the output is a valid Ed25519 curve point. This is IETF-standardized, not ad-hoc.
- **Determinism**: The curve point is derived solely from the public string `KEETA_BURN_FUCKING_ADDRESS`.
- **Discrete Log Hardness**: Finding a private key (Ed25519 scalar) that produces this public point requires solving the discrete logarithm problem—computationally infeasible.

**RESULT**: No private key exists. No one can spend from this address. Tokens sent here are **permanently and irrevocably locked**.
